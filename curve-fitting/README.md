# curve-fitting:

This program shows how we can use an `Optimizer` to perform curve fitting
on any arbitrary equation. It generates synthetic data that approximately
follows a predetermined cubic function, then uses TF to learn what the
coefficients to that cubic function were based on repeated training attempts
on the synthetic dataset.
